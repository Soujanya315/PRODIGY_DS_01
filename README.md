This project aims to visualize the distribution of age and gender in a population using a bar chart or histogram. By analyzing demographic data, the project provides insights into the composition of the population, highlighting trends and patterns in age groups and gender representation.
The dataset includes age and gender information collected from a survey or demographic study. It is structured to allow for easy aggregation and analysis.
The goal is to facilitate understanding of demographic trends, which can inform policy-making, marketing strategies, and community planning. The visualizations help stakeholders quickly grasp the population dynamics.
