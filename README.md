This project analyzes social media sentiment to understand public opinion towards specific topics or brands. Using a dataset of posts, the project implements sentiment scoring to classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral. Visualizations created in Tableau include bar charts for sentiment distribution and line charts for sentiment trends over time. The goal is to provide insights into user attitudes and engagement, enabling data-driven decision-making for marketing and brand management. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of data visualization tools in interpreting social media sentiment data.
